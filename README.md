# Windows System Information Tool

This project is a comprehensive Windows-based application designed to provide real-time system information and resource monitoring. It leverages various Windows API functions to gather and display critical system metrics such as memory usage, disk usage, network information, CPU details, and OS version. Featuring a user-friendly graphical interface, the tool allows users to easily access detailed system information through interactive modules, message boxes, and graphical representations.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OSLabProject.git
   cd OSLabProject
   ```

2. **Create a New Project in Code::Blocks:**
   - Launch Code::Blocks IDE.
   - Go to `File` -> `New` -> `Project...`.
   - Select `Console Application` and follow the prompts to create a new C++ project.

3. **Copy the Code:**
   - Open the `main.cpp` file from the cloned repository.
   - Copy the entire code from `main.cpp`.

4. **Save the Code in Code::Blocks:**
   - In your new Code::Blocks project, create a new file by navigating to `File` -> `New` -> `Empty file`.
   - Paste the copied code into this new file.
   - Save the file as `main.cpp` in your project directory.

5. **Build the Project:**
   - In Code::Blocks, go to `Build` -> `Build` or press `F9` to compile the project.

6. **Run the Application:**
   - In Code::Blocks, go to `Build` -> `Run` or press `Ctrl+F10` to execute the compiled application.

7. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
     - Windows SDK
     - Code::Blocks IDE (with MinGW compiler)

8. **Usage Instructions:**
   - Launch the application.
   - Use the graphical interface to navigate through various modules:
     - Display System Time
     - Display Memory Information
     - Display OS Version
     - Display Disk Information
     - Display Network Information
     - Display Real-Time System Info
     - Display CPU Information

9. **Troubleshooting:**
   - If you encounter any issues, check the console for error messages and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
